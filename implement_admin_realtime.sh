echo "=========================="

echo "📋 What was implemented:"
echo "• ✅ Updated backend page cache middleware to exclude admin routes"
echo "• ✅ Added real-time headers middleware for admin panel"
echo "• ✅ Enhanced Caddy configuration with WebSocket support"
echo "• ✅ Separated admin API routes with no-cache headers"
echo "• ✅ Added comprehensive cache bypass for admin operations"
echo ""
echo "🧪 Testing Instructions:"
echo "1. Open public blog: http://localhost/blog"
echo "   - Should have caching headers (Cache-Control: max-age=600)"
echo ""
echo "2. Open admin dashboard: http://localhost/admin/dashboard"
echo "   - Should have no-cache headers (Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store)"
echo "   - Should show X-Admin-Realtime: enabled header"
echo ""
echo "3. Test real-time behavior:"
echo "   - Make changes in admin panel"
echo "   - Data should update immediately without browser refresh"
echo ""
echo "🔍 Debug Commands:"
echo "# Check public blog caching:"
echo "curl -I http://localhost/blog"
echo ""
echo "# Check admin no-cache:"
echo "curl -I http://localhost/admin/dashboard"
echo ""
echo "# Check admin API headers:"
echo "curl -I -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN' http://localhost/api/admin/users"
echo ""
echo "📊 View logs:"
echo "./manage.sh logs"
echo ""
echo "🎉 Admin panel should now have real-time updates with zero caching!"
