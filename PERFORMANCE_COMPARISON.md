## 🔍 **Detailed Metrics**

### **System Resource Impact:**
```
Before Migration (Docker estimated):
- Memory overhead: ~200MB daemon
- CPU overhead: ~2-3% background
- Storage overhead: ~500MB system

After Migration (Docker actual):
- Memory overhead: ~50MB tools
- CPU overhead: ~0.5% background
- Storage overhead: ~200MB system
```

### **Developer Experience:**
```
Docker Commands → Docker Commands
docker build   → podman build    ✅ Compatible
docker run     → podman run      ✅ Compatible  
docker-compose → podman compose  ✅ Compatible
docker ps      → podman ps       ✅ Compatible
```
